**Features:-**Sepal_length,Sepal_width,petal_length,petal_width
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import nbformat

# Read the .dat file
data = pd.read_csv('iris.data', delimiter=',')
data.to_excel('iris.xlsx', index=False)
print(data)
num_df = data.select_dtypes(include = 'number')
```
# Descriptive Statistics 
```{python}
def descriptive_statistics(num):
    # Calculate and print descriptive statistics for each numeric column
    print("Descriptive Statistics:\n")
    for column in num.columns:
        print(f"Statistics for {column}")
        print('--------------------------------')
        print(f"Mean: {num[column].mean()}")
        print(f"Median: {num[column].median()}")
        print(f"Mode: {num[column].mode().iloc[0]}")
        print(f"Standard Deviation: {num[column].std()}")

# Histogram Plot
## Plot for Sepal Length 
```{python}
# Set up the FacetGrid for Sepal Length
g = sns.FacetGrid(data, col="class", margin_titles=True, col_wrap=3)
g.map(plt.hist, "sepal length", bins=10, color="steelblue", edgecolor="black")
g.fig.suptitle("Histogram of Sepal Length by Species", y=1.05)
plt.show()
```

The above plot shows the distribution of sepal lengths for each species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Each subplot represents a different species, allowing for an easy comparison of sepal length distributions between the species.<br>
**Iris-setosa:-**<br>The sepal lengths are mostly concentrated between 4.5 and 5.5 cm. The distribution appears to be more tightly clustered compared to the other species.<br>
**Iris-versicolor:-**<br>The sepal lengths are more spread out, typically ranging from 5.0 to 7.0 cm, with a peak around 5.5 to 6.0 cm.<br>
**Iris-virginica:-** <br>The sepal lengths show a broader distribution, generally ranging from 6.0 to 7.5 cm. This species has the longest sepals on average.

### Plot for Sepal Width

```{python}
# Set up the FacetGrid for Sepal Width
g = sns.FacetGrid(data, col="class", margin_titles=True, col_wrap=3)
g.map(plt.hist, "sepal width", bins=10, color="steelblue", edgecolor="black")
g.fig.suptitle("Histogram of Sepal Width by Species", y=1.05)
plt.show()
```
The above plot shows the distribution of sepal width for each iris class. Each subplot represents a different species, allowing comparison of sepal width distribution.<br>
**Iris-setosa:-**<br>The sepal width are mostly between 3.0 and 4.0 cm. This iris_setosa tends to have wider sepals compared to the other two.<br>
**Iris-versicolor:-**<br>The sepal width are distributed between 2.5 and 3.5 cm, with a peak around 2.8 to 3.0 cm.<br>
**Iris-virginica:-**<br>The sepal widths range from 2.5 to 3.5 cm, with a slight peak around 3.0 cm, similar to Iris-versicolor.<br>

# Scatter Plot
Here we can see the scatter plots to visualize the relationships between the features in the Iris dataset, with each species represented by a different color. We'll create scatter plots for the following pairs of features:

```{python}
# Scatter plot for Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width
sns.scatterplot(data, x="sepal length", y="sepal width", hue="class", palette="Set1", edgecolor="black")
plt.title("Sepal Length vs. Sepal Width by Species")
plt.show()
```
The above scatter plot shows the relationship between sepal length and sepal width for the three Iris species.<br>

**Iris-setosa:-** <br>Data points for this species are well-separated from the others, forming a distinct cluster with shorter sepal lengths and wider sepal widths.<br>
**Iris-versicolor:-** <br>Data points are more spread out, overlapping slightly with Iris-virginica but generally forming a cluster with moderate sepal lengths and widths.<br>
**Iris-virginica:-**<br>Data points are also spread out but tend to have longer sepal lengths and narrower sepal widths compared to Iris-setosa.<br>

```{python}
# Scatter plot for Petal Length vs. Petal Width

## Box Plot
```{python}
# Box plot
sns.boxplot(data, x="class", y="sepal width",hue='class', palette="Set3")
plt.title("Box Plot of Sepal Width by Species")
plt.show()
```
The box plot provides a clear visual comparison of the sepal widths across the three Iris species:<br>
Iris-setosa has the widest range of sepal widths, with the highest median value and the greatest variability.<br>
Iris-versicolor has a narrower range of sepal widths with a lower median compared to Iris-setosa.<br>
Iris-virginica has a sepal width distribution similar to Iris-versicolor, with moderate variability and a comparable median value.<br>

```{python}
# Box plot
sns.boxplot(data, x="class", y="sepal length",hue='class', palette="Set3")
plt.title("Box Plot of Sepal length by Species")
plt.show()
```

A box plot is a standardized way of displaying the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It also highlights outliers, if any.
Box Plot Interpretation<br>
**Iris-setosa:-**<br>
Median (Q2): The central line inside the box represents the median sepal length.<br>
**Interquartile Range (IQR):**<br> The box represents the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3).
**Whiskers:**<br> The lines extending from the box show the range of the data within 1.5 times the IQR from Q1 and Q3. Data points outside this range are considered outliers.<br>
**Outliers:**<br> Points outside the whiskers, if any, represent outliers in the sepal length distribution.
**Iris-versicolor:-**<br>
The median sepal length is higher than that of Iris-setosa.
The IQR is larger, indicating more variability in sepal lengths.
The whiskers and potential outliers provide insight into the spread and extremes of the data.<br>
**Iris-virginica:-**<br>
The median sepal length is the highest among the three species.
The IQR is comparable to Iris-versicolor but larger than Iris-setosa, indicating substantial variability.<br>
The whiskers and any outliers show the spread and extremities of the sepal length for this species.<br>
The box plot provides a clear visual comparison of the sepal lengths across the three Iris species:<br>
Iris-setosa has the shortest sepal lengths, with minimal variability.<br>
Iris-versicolor has moderate sepal lengths with greater variability compared to Iris-setosa.<br>
Iris-virginica has the longest sepal lengths with significant variability.<br>
This visualization is useful for understanding the distribution and spread of sepal lengths within and across the species, highlighting the central tendency and variability, as well as any potential outliers in the data.<br>

```{python}
# Box plot
