## Projects

### MouseLess Cursor using Facial Movements

The main objective of mouseless cursor control using facial movement is to provide an alternative method for computer users who are unable to use a traditional mouse due to physical limitations or disabilities. By using facial movements, users can more easily navigate their computer screens.

### Automatic Text Generation Using LSTM

LSTM-based automatic text generation involves training a neural network to learn patterns in a dataset and generate new text based on those patterns. The objective is to minimize the difference between the generated and actual text using a loss function.

### Data Extracting
The objective of this data extraction process is to efficiently and accurately retrieve relevant data from specified sources to enable detailed analysis, reporting, and visualization. This process aims to ensure that the data collected is comprehensive, high-quality, and aligns with the requirements of the project.

### Car Prize Prediction
To develop a predictive model using linear regression that accurately estimates car prices based on various features such as ,bore,stroke,normalized-losses,horsepower,and brand, with the goal of providing reliable price assessments to assist buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
