## Projects

### MouseLess Cursor using Facial Movements

The main objective of mouseless cursor control using facial movement is to provide an alternative method for computer users who are unable to use a traditional mouse due to physical limitations or disabilities. By using facial movements, users can more easily navigate their computer screens.

### Object Tracking Using Camshift Algorithm

It is an application of deep learning which is used to develop a unique identification for each of the initial detections and then track the detected objects as they move around frames in video.

### Automatic Text Generation Using LSTM

LSTM-based automatic text generation involves training a neural network to learn patterns in a dataset and generate new text based on those patterns. The objective is to minimize the difference between the generated and actual text using a loss function.
